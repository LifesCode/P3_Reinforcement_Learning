During the implementation of this Project we, members of the group, found some errors that occurred
for reasons that were not related to our side of the code. By this we mean that given modules
which shouldn't have been alterated, were creating errors. With the options of either not do the 
assignment, or alter this modules in order for our implementation to work; we decided to go with
the last one. 
  We will, in this file, list all the alteration made to the (originally) unalterable
modules.

Note: We only made alterations when there was no other option left for us to take in order to complete
the assignment.
